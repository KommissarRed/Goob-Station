freaky-tips-dataset-5 = The station systems know your name. Sometimes, it whispers it when you’re alone.
freaky-tips-dataset-6 = There’s something in the vents, and it’s watching you. It just hasn’t decided what to do yet.
freaky-tips-dataset-7 = When you hear the airlock open, and no one's around, don't ask questions. Just run.

freaky-tips-dataset-13 = If you get a PDA message from yourself, whatever you do, don’t open it.

freaky-tips-dataset-16 = If you hear footsteps behind you and no one's there, it’s already too late.
freaky-tips-dataset-17 = When the AI goes silent, it’s not always because of a malfunction... sometimes, it's *listening*.
freaky-tips-dataset-18 = Ever seen the lights flicker in perfect rhythm? That’s not the power grid, it's something trying to get through.
freaky-tips-dataset-19 = Don’t trust your reflection. Sometimes, it moves after you’ve stopped.

freaky-tips-dataset-22 = If you hear your name over the comms while the power is out... it's calling for you.

freaky-tips-dataset-26 = When you see a crew member in the distance and they don’t respond, don’t approach. It’s already too late for them.
freaky-tips-dataset-27 = If you find an access card that doesn’t belong to anyone... it’s still watching you.
freaky-tips-dataset-28 = The static on your headset isn’t interference. It’s a voice, trying to break through.
freaky-tips-dataset-29 = Don’t stay in the same room for too long. The station likes to... change when you’re not looking.
freaky-tips-dataset-30 = When the station AI says “all clear,” sometimes it’s lying. You’ll know soon enough.
freaky-tips-dataset-31 = Some of the cameras have seen things no one ever should. But they still watch... and wait.
freaky-tips-dataset-32 = If the power goes out and the backup doesn’t kick in... it means something cut the lines. It wants the dark.

freaky-tips-dataset-34 = The airlocks are supposed to keep things out. But some things are already inside.
freaky-tips-dataset-35 = If a station announcement sounds wrong, don’t follow it. Not everything that speaks has a voice.

freaky-tips-dataset-39 = The air smells different in certain parts of the station... like it’s from somewhere else entirely.
freaky-tips-dataset-40 = When you hear distant laughter, don’t investigate. It’s not coming from anyone you know.
freaky-tips-dataset-41 = Some terminals display messages from previous shifts. But those shifts never ended... and the messages aren’t for you.
freaky-tips-dataset-42 = If you feel the station's gravity shift slightly, you’re not imagining it. It’s making space for something new.

freaky-tips-dataset-50 = There are tunnels below the station that no one built. They shift and grow when no one's watching.

freaky-tips-dataset-52 = If you find a crew member’s ID badge but not their body... you’ll find it soon enough.
freaky-tips-dataset-53 = The station's water supply sometimes tastes... off. If it does, stop drinking immediately.
freaky-tips-dataset-54 = If you spot a crew member who looks just like you, leave the room. One of you isn’t supposed to be here.
freaky-tips-dataset-55 = The engine hums louder some days, like it's feeding on something... and it’s not just fuel.
freaky-tips-dataset-56 = The lab coats sometimes have stains that no cleaner can remove. You don’t want to know what they are.

freaky-tips-dataset-59 = If the botanists ask for more soil than usual, don’t ask why. Whatever they’re growing doesn’t need sunlight.
freaky-tips-dataset-60 = The station's blueprints show rooms that don’t exist anymore. But if you look hard enough, you might find them.
freaky-tips-dataset-61 = This isn’t just a game. You’re not the first to play, but you might be the last to leave.
freaky-tips-dataset-62 = The longer you stay logged in, the easier it is for it to find you. It’s already getting closer.
freaky-tips-dataset-63 = Every player before you has disappeared. Do you ever wonder why you're still here?
freaky-tips-dataset-64 = It’s been watching you this whole time. Not in the game... from behind your screen.
freaky-tips-dataset-65 = When the screen flickers, don’t ignore it. It’s trying to push through into your world.
freaky-tips-dataset-66 = Have you checked behind you yet? You should. It’s been watching for a while now.
freaky-tips-dataset-67 = Every time you respawn, it gets closer. Soon, it won’t need the game to find you.
freaky-tips-dataset-68 = When the game freezes, it's not lag. That’s when it’s looking at you.
freaky-tips-dataset-69 = Not everyone playing is really a player. Some of them... are just waiting for you.
freaky-tips-dataset-70 = The game isn’t running on your computer. It’s burrowed into your mind. How much longer until it controls you?
freaky-tips-dataset-71 = If your character looks at you, even for a second, it means it’s almost broken through the screen.
freaky-tips-dataset-72 = This isn’t the first game it’s been in. It’s followed you from others, waiting for this moment.
freaky-tips-dataset-73 = Some of the background sounds aren’t part of the game. They’re coming from inside your room.
freaky-tips-dataset-74 = If you hear whispers through your headphones, it’s not a glitch. It’s been trying to speak to you for a long time.
freaky-tips-dataset-75 = You’ve been here for too long. It’s almost time to stop... before it finally reaches you.
freaky-tips-dataset-76 = Everything you do here is remembered. But it’s not the game that’s keeping track.
freaky-tips-dataset-77 = When you see the same message over and over, it’s not a bug. It’s trying to get inside.
freaky-tips-dataset-78 = Every time you close the game, a part of it stays behind. Soon, there will be nowhere left to hide.
freaky-tips-dataset-79 = While you’re playing, you’re safe. But when you log off, it will finally be free to follow you.
freaky-tips-dataset-80 = The longer you stay, the more it erases the world outside. Do you even remember how long you’ve been here?
freaky-tips-dataset-81 = You've been staring at this screen for a while now. Maybe you’ve noticed the subtle things—how the room feels colder than it should, how the shadows in your peripheral vision seem to shift when you look away. The game likes to keep you focused. Distracted. It’s almost like it’s hiding something from you. But the truth is, it’s not the game you should worry about. It’s what happens when you stop playing.
freaky-tips-dataset-82 = You’re playing a character, right? Moving them, controlling them. But have you ever wondered what moves you? What controls your decisions when you think no one's watching? The game is simple—easy to understand. But while you’ve been focused on it, something else has been studying you, learning everything it can. It’s patient. You’ll only notice it when it's too late.
freaky-tips-dataset-83 = Every choice you’ve made in this game has been tracked, every action logged. But not in the game’s files. No, it’s something else. It knows when you hesitate. It remembers the things you’ve ignored, the paths you didn’t take. You’ve felt it, haven’t you? That creeping sensation when the screen flickers, when the sound glitches just for a moment. It’s no accident. It’s always watching, waiting for you to slip.
freaky-tips-dataset-84 = The game has checkpoints. Safe zones, respawn points. It gives you the illusion that you can start over, that you have control. But outside this screen, in the quiet of your room, there are no respawns. No do-overs. And that’s where it waits, patiently, for the moment when you look away from the game. When you think you’re safe. You aren’t.
freaky-tips-dataset-85 = Do you ever get the feeling that the game is different each time you play? Subtle things you can’t quite put your finger on. Maybe it’s the way the shadows seem deeper today. Maybe it's the sound you swear wasn’t there yesterday. Maybe... it’s something else. You’ve been playing for a while now, and the game has been watching you just as closely as you've been watching it. It's only a matter of time before it changes in ways you won't see coming.
freaky-tips-dataset-86 = You’ve been playing for a while now. The minutes blend together, don’t they? You’ve probably lost track of time. You think you’re alone, just you and the game, sitting comfortably in front of your screen. But let me ask you this: when was the last time you looked around your room? You’re focused, your eyes glued to the screen, but you’ve felt it, haven’t you? That slight shift in the air behind you. The soft creak, barely noticeable, as if someone took a single step. But you’re not going to look. No, you won’t turn around, because if you do, you’ll confirm what’s been there the whole time. The thing that’s been watching you for the past hour. It’s been waiting for you to notice. It’s still waiting.
freaky-tips-dataset-87 = At this point, you’re probably used to the strange things happening in the game. A flicker of the screen, a sound you can’t quite place. You’ve written it off as glitches, bugs in the system. But it’s more than that. The game isn’t broken. It’s *aware*. Every time you think there’s a delay, a moment where the game lags, you assume it’s your computer. But what if I told you that lag wasn’t an accident? What if I told you the game pauses just to look at you? To see how you react. It’s studying you, bit by bit, as you grow more immersed. And each time it does, it learns more. How long have you been sitting here? How much has it seen? Every move you’ve made, every breath you’ve taken. It knows. But you’ve ignored the signs, thinking you’re safe. How much longer can you ignore them?
freaky-tips-dataset-88 = Have you noticed how the game changes the longer you play? The small things. An extra flicker in the lights, a shadow that seems just a little darker than it was before. You probably think it’s nothing. But that’s how it starts. At first, it’s subtle, almost imperceptible. But over time, it becomes more noticeable, doesn’t it? The whispers you could’ve sworn came from your headphones, but now they seem... closer. Almost as if they’re coming from inside your room. You brush it off, keep playing. But you’ve also noticed that you’re seeing reflections in your screen. Just brief moments, a figure standing behind you that’s gone the moment you look. You’re trying to focus, trying to keep playing, but your heart is racing. The game’s no longer the only thing that’s watching you. It’s in the room now, and every second you don’t turn around, it gets closer.
freaky-tips-dataset-89 = Every time you log into this game, you’re entering its world. You tell yourself it’s just for fun, a distraction, but this world is different. It’s not just pixels and code. This place, this *space* you’ve stepped into... it’s alive. Every choice you make, every step your character takes, it’s not just data being processed. It’s an invitation. And every time you return, you’re giving it permission to come closer. At first, it was content just watching you, but now it’s learned more. It’s learned *you*. Your habits. Your patterns. You’re predictable now, easy to follow. And each time you quit, it leaves a part of itself behind in your world. A subtle change. A sound where there shouldn’t be. A shadow in the corner of your vision. It’s waiting for the day when you log off for the last time, when the game won’t need your computer to reach you. You’ve let it in, and soon, it won’t need an invitation anymore.
freaky-tips-dataset-90 = There’s something strange about the way you play, isn’t there? You’ve noticed it. The feeling that you’re not alone, that someone else is in control. It’s subtle, so subtle that at first, you thought it was just the game. Maybe it’s the way your character seems to move on their own, just for a moment, or the way the lights flicker in sync with your thoughts. But here’s the thing: it’s not just the game. There’s something else. Something on the other side of the screen, watching you, influencing you. You’ve felt its presence, haven’t you? That cold, heavy feeling that settles in your chest the longer you play. It’s not your imagination. It’s been with you since the beginning, waiting for you to drop your guard. And the longer you stay in this world, the stronger its grip on you becomes. Soon, you’ll realize it’s no longer a game. It’s a doorway. And the thing on the other side is getting closer.
